### Exam Day Tips

1. Use the first 5 minutes to quickly scan the entire paper and categorize questions
2. Follow a 3-round approach: first solve all easy questions, then moderate ones, and finally difficult ones
3. For numerical problems, double-check units and perform quick estimations
4. When stuck on a problem, mark it for review and move on - don't waste time
5. Manage negative marking strategically - attempt questions only if you can eliminate at least one option
6. Use the last 15 minutes for reviewing marked questions and ensuring all answers are correctly transferred
